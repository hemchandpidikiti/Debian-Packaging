# Debian Packaging
Packaging a program or a software make its portabilty,deployment easier.
An end-user without managing to run/work on programs manually, the work can be made in form of scripts and further to packages.
Thus these packages are made available to end user through several platforms and a end-user can work with the applications installed through several package managers (say Apt, packman etc.) 
This helps a user easily work with application/software without much burden on installation.
Thus the usability and accessibility of a software can be in an extensive way.
Through this project we intend to acomplish the following goals:
* Having knowledge on how several Deb packages are built and made available for installation.
* Methodology used for building Debian Packages.
* Basic shell scripting in bash etc..

**Ultimate goal:** The final outcome of this project is to provide upgraded versions of Balaswecha Packages.(Pencilbox etc. )
